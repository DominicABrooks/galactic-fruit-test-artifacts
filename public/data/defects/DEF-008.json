    "description": "Non-primary doors open normally when interacting with the button using [E] or mouse click. However, once opened, these doors cannot be closed again when pressing the button. Only the main door properly supports both open and close states. This suggests a missing animation or incomplete interaction logic for secondary doors.",
    "steps": [
        "1. Enter the ship area.",
        "2. Approach any non-main door.",
        "3. Press [E] to open the door.",
        "4. Attempt to close the same door using [E] again.",
        "5. Observe that the door remains open."
    ],
    "expected": "All interactable doors should support toggling between open and closed states, unless intentionally restricted.",
    "actual": "Secondary doors only open; they never close after activation.",
