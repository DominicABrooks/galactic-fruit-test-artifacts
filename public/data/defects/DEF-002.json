    "description": "During the initial game introduction sequence, interacting with a disabled button next to the door provides no audio feedback. Normally, pressing 'E' on non-interactable objects triggers a 'brrp' sound to indicate invalid interaction, but this feedback is missing for disabled buttons.",
    "steps": [
        "1. Launch the game through Steam Client (Build 20951743).",
        "2. Approach and interact with the suit using [E].",
        "3. Climb the ladder using [E].",
        "4. Press [E] in mid-air pointing at nothing; observe 'brrp' audio feedback.",
        "5. Walk up to the disabled button next to the door and press [E].",
        "6. Observe that no audio feedback occurs."
    ],
    "expected": "Pressing [E] on a disabled button should produce the same 'brrp' sound as interacting with non-interactable objects, indicating the action is invalid.",
    "actual": "Pressing [E] on the disabled button produces no audio feedback; the player receives no indication the interaction is invalid.",
