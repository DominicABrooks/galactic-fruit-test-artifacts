Terminal Availability After Manual\r\n- Following completion of exploratory session INTRO-002, a third terminal was added on the left side.\r\n- This terminal corresponds to the Camera system mentioned in the Operations Manual.\r\n- Right terminal (Map) was available since initially boarding the ship.\r\n\r\n### 2. Map Terminal Exploration\r\n- Interacted with the map terminal.\r\n- Display showed two squads: [1] and [0].\r\n- Operations Manual states map is relative to System 23 (current destination).\r\n- No additional information provided beyond system reference.\r\n- **Observation:** Limited information available; recommended to developer to either:\r\n  - Provide more detailed map information, or\r\n  - Disable map terminal until more context is available.\r\n\r\n### 3. Camera Terminal Initial View\r\n- Interacted with the camera terminal.\r\n- Three UI elements immediately visible:\r\n  - Top left: \"0/0\" text overlay\r\n  - Bottom center: \"[Set Course: E]\" text overlay\r\n  - Center: Crosshair overlay\r\n- Planet visible to the right of the crosshair.\r\n\r\n### 4. Camera Movement Controls\r\n- Camera controls using [WASD]:\r\n  - [W] moves camera up\r\n  - [S] moves camera down\r\n  - [A] moves camera left\r\n  - [D] moves camera right\r\n- Movement is smooth and responsive.\r\n\r\n### 5. Camera Boundary Behavior\r\n- Moving too far in any direction triggers boundary limit:\r\n  - Camera stops moving in that direction\r\n  - Red line appears as visual indicator\r\n  - Sound effect plays to signal boundary reached\r\n\r\n### 6. Planet Interaction & Course Selection\r\n- Hovered over the planet.\r\n- Clicked [E] or [LMB] to interact.\r\n- Prompt appeared: \"[X] SET COURSE [C]\"\r\n- Interaction options:\r\n  - [X] to cancel\r\n  - [C] or [LMB] to confirm course\r\n\r\n### 7. Course Confirmation\r\n- Clicked [C] or [LMB] to set course.\r\n- Display showed: \"Expected Duration: 22 Weeks\"\r\n- Camera terminal automatically turned off after confirmation.\r\n- Sequence progression triggered.\r\n\r\n## Session Conclusion\r\nExploratory session complete. Successfully explored Map and Camera terminals. Map terminal shows limited information requiring developer clarification. Camera system functions as expected with clear boundaries, movement controls, and planet selection mechanics. Course successfully set to destination with 22-week duration displayed.

Post-Course Setting State\r\n- Following completion of exploratory session INTRO-003, after setting course to the first planet:\r\n  - All terminals were disabled\r\n  - Lights were turned off\r\n  - Ship entered transit state\r\n\r\n### 2. Main Door Interaction\r\n- Interacted with the door button using [E].\r\n- Door played slow opening animation with sound effect.\r\n- After door was fully open, clicking [E] on the button started closing the door.\r\n- **Defect Identified:** Clicking [E] on the door button multiple times rapidly skipped the animation.\r\n  - Expected: Animation should play completely regardless of input spam\r\n  - Actual: Animation can be skipped with rapid inputs\r\n\r\n### 3. Ship Hallway Layout\r\n- Large hallway revealed with corridor containing multiple rooms.\r\n- Room layout (first to last):\r\n  - **Electrical** (right side)\r\n  - **Administration** (left side)\r\n  - **Lounge** (right side)\r\n  - **Waste** (left side)\r\n  - **Hibernation** (end of hallway)\r\n\r\n### 4. Intersection Discovery\r\n- Hallway contains an intersection between Administration and Lounge rooms.\r\n- Intersection features:\r\n  - Can walk left or right at the intersection\r\n  - Each direction ends with a ramp (going up or down)\r\n  - Ramps are blocked by invisible walls\r\n  - Camera present in each section of the intersection (left & right)\r\n\r\n### 5. Side Room Door Mechanics\r\n- Side room doors use unique opening animation:\r\n  - Door slides completely from right to left (not meeting in middle)\r\n  - Doors automatically close after approximately 2 seconds\r\n  - Different behavior from main ship door\r\n\r\n### 6. Room Exploration Results\r\n- **Electrical Room:**\r\n  - Door opens successfully\r\n  - Small room containing:\r\n    - Camera\r\n    - Electrical object (not interactable at this time)\r\n- **Administration Room:**\r\n  - Unable to interact with door\r\n  - Room remains locked\r\n- **Lounge Room:**\r\n  - Unable to interact with door\r\n  - Room remains locked\r\n- **Waste Room:**\r\n  - Door opens successfully\r\n  - Small empty room with red tint\r\n  - No interactable objects\r\n\r\n### 7. Hibernation Room & Cryochamber\r\n- Interacted with Hibernation door at end of hallway.\r\n- Room opened revealing:\r\n  - Camera\r\n  - Interactable Cryochamber object\r\n- Clicked [E] or [LMB] on Cryochamber.\r\n- Screen immediately faded to black.\r\n- Display showed: \"...\"\r\n\r\n### 8. Hibernation Sequence & Region Transition\r\n- After period of time in hibernation, sound effect played.\r\n- Player character exited cryochamber.\r\n- Using dev tools, confirmed region changed from initial to **0b**.\r\n- This marks the conclusion of the ship introduction sequence.\r\n\r\n## Session Conclusion\r\nExploratory session complete.

Region Transition & Entry\r\n- After completing 0b region exploration, entered cryochamber for hibernation.\r\n- Upon awakening, developer tools confirmed transition to **Region 1**.\r\n\r\n### 2. Hallway Lighting Sequence\r\n- Opened door to hallway.\r\n- Lighting behavior observed:\r\n  - Lights began activating from opposite side of hallway\r\n  - Lights turned on incrementally, creating visual sequence\r\n  - Different from previous regions' instant lighting\r\n\r\n### 3. Room Status Check\r\n- Walked through hallway to inspect all rooms.\r\n- Findings: No differences observed from 0b region rooms.\r\n- Proceeded directly to cockpit.\r\n\r\n### 4. New Filesystem Content & Camera Interface\r\n- Inspected **Filesystem** terminal.\r\n- New file discovered: **SAFETY.a**\r\n- Camera system changes:\r\n  - Display showed: **0/1** overlay in top right corner\r\n  - Interpreted as: 1 scannable object available, 0 scanned\r\n\r\n### 5. Initial Planet Discovery - Ladagocia\r\n- Located planet **Ladagocia** in camera view.\r\n- Attempted interaction using [E] and [LMB].\r\n- System response: **\"REPORT ON PLANET BEFORE CONTINUING\"**\r\n- Interaction blocked until prerequisite completed.\r\n\r\n### 6. SAFETY.a Training Video\r\n- Returned to **Filesystem** terminal to investigate SAFETY.a file.\r\n- Running SAFETY.a initiated video playback.\r\n- Video content: Safety briefing about power restoration procedures.\r\n- Key information: \"If power goes out, restore it in the electrical room.\"\r\n\r\n### 7. Camera Re-check & Second Planet Discovery\r\n- Re-interacted with camera after viewing SAFETY.a.\r\n- **Ladagocia** still displayed same message: \"REPORT ON PLANET BEFORE CONTINUING\"\r\n- Continued searching camera view for other planets.\r\n- Located different planet with new interaction prompt: **[SCAN: E]**\r\n\r\n### 8. Planet Scanning Mechanic - Cerebellum\r\n- Tested scanning mechanic on newly discovered planet.\r\n- Scan controls:\r\n  - Hold [E] to initiate and maintain scan animation\r\n  - Releasing [E] stops animation\r\n  - Must hold [E] for full animation duration to complete scan\r\n- Upon successful scan completion:\r\n  - System message: **Planet discovered: 'Cerebellum'**\r\n  - New file automatically added to Filesystem: **Cerebellum.kp4**\r\n\r\n### 9. Cerebellum.kp4 Minigame\r\n- Ran **Cerebellum.kp4** from Filesystem terminal.\r\n- Minigame initiated with timing challenge:\r\n  - Slider moves around circular track\r\n  - Small red sections mark target zones\r\n  - Player must click [LMB] when slider reaches red sections\r\n  - Timing-based success condition\r\n\r\n### 10. Report Generation System\r\n- Upon minigame completion, new file generated: **report.kp4**\r\n- Running report.kp4 initiated two-part sequence:\r\n  1. Video playback\r\n  2. Interactive **Cerebellum Report** interface opened\r\n- Report interface mechanics:\r\n  - Multiple button options displayed\r\n  - Clicking button adds corresponding word(s) to report\r\n  - Example: Clicking 'aaa' added three words: \"Detemeter > GFHQ\"\r\n  - Progressive report building through button selections\r\n\r\n### 11. Map Update & Mission Progression\r\n- Upon completing **Cerebellum** report:\r\n  - Camera view automatically moved to map display\r\n  - Map indicator **[1]** changed to **checkmark** symbol (✓)\r\n  - Focus automatically returned to camera\r\n  - Camera immediately centered on **Ladagocia** planet\r\n\r\n### 12. Course Setting - Ladagocia\r\n- Interacted with **Ladagocia** again after report completion.\r\n- Previous blocking message replaced with new prompt: **\"[X] SET COURSE [C]\"**\r\n- Tested controls:\r\n  - Clicking [X] closes the prompt (cancel action)\r\n  - Re-interacted with planet using [E]\r\n  - Pressed [C] but nothing happened\r\n    - This is a defect, will make a ticket.\r\n  - Tried Pressed [LMB] to confirm course setting\r\n- System response:\r\n  - Display showed: **\"Expected duration: 17 weeks\"**\r\n  - All screens faded to black\r\n  - Ship entered transit state\r\n\r\n### 13. Return to Hibernation\r\n- Navigated back through hallway to hibernation room.\r\n- Room inspection results: No changes detected in any hallway rooms.\r\n- Proceeded to hibernation room.\r\n- Interacted with **Cryochamber** to initiate hibernation.\r\n\r\n### 14. Region Transition to Region 2\r\n- After hibernation sequence (\"...\"), awakened in new region.\r\n- Developer tools confirmed transition to **Region 2**.\r\n- This marks conclusion of Region 1 exploration.\r\n\r\n## Session Conclusion\r\nExploratory session complete. Successfully explored Region 1 and discovered new gameplay systems including hallway lighting sequences, planet scanning mechanics, and report generation. Completed SAFETY.a training video, discovered and scanned Cerebellum planet, successfully completed timing-based minigame, and generated planet report. Map progression system confirmed working (checkpoint [1] marked complete). Successfully set course to Ladagocia with 17-week transit time and transitioned to Region 2 via hibernation.

Entry into 0b Region\r\n- Upon entering the 0b region, navigated to the cockpit.\r\n- Region transition occurred after hibernation sequence from intro area.\r\n\r\n### 2. Neuros Terminal Discovery\r\n- **Neuros** terminal discovered on the left side of the cockpit.\r\n- Terminal features:\r\n  - New terminal type not present in previous region\r\n  - Interactable using [E] or [LMB]\r\n\r\n### 3. Neuros CLI Interface\r\n- Clicking on **Neuros** terminal opens CLI (Command Line Interface) tool.\r\n- System immediately prints: \"NEUROS ONLINE\"\r\n- Input behavior:\r\n  - All typed letters are automatically converted to uppercase\r\n  - Command-based interaction system\r\n\r\n### 4. HELP Command & Database Entries\r\n- Typing 'HELP' command displays list of available entries:\r\n  - **Galactic Fruit**\r\n  - **Fabrica**\r\n  - **Ladagocia** \r\n  - **Mesdoion**\r\n- Typing any of these terms displays description of the corresponding planet or object.\r\n- Exit mechanism: Clicking [RMB] closes the Neuros terminal.\r\n\r\n### 5. Paper Placement Issue\r\n- Paper that was previously mounted on wall is now on the floor.\r\n- Interaction behavior:\r\n  - Clicking on paper repositions it back to original wall location\r\n  - **Defect Identified:** Paper placement obscures the Neuros terminal\r\n    - Expected: Paper should not block interactive terminals\r\n    - Actual: Paper covers Neuros terminal when placed, preventing interaction\r\n\r\n### 6. Filesystem Terminal Check\r\n- Navigated to cockpit and interacted with **Filesystem** terminal.\r\n- Power status confirmed: **Power: 5** (unchanged from previous region)\r\n- New file discovered in 'Temp' directory: **Evaluation.kp4**\r\n\r\n### 7. Evaluation.kp4 Minigame\r\n- Running Evaluation.kp4 file initiates minigame sequence.\r\n- Minigame instructions: \"Click 'the button' when a red face appears\"\r\n- Sequence observed:\r\n  - Green face displayed first\r\n  - Screen goes black\r\n  - Red face appears\r\n- Pressed [E] (intuited as correct button) when red face appeared.\r\n- Result: Successful completion of minigame.\r\n\r\n### 8. Camera & Scanning Attempt\r\n- Interacted with camera system.\r\n- Display showed: **0/0** in top right corner.\r\n- Attempted to scan for planets or objects.\r\n- Result: No scannable objects detected in 0b region.\r\n\r\n### 9. Return to Hibernation\r\n- Turned around and navigated back to hibernation room for cryosleep.\r\n- Conducted thorough check of all rooms along the route.\r\n- Findings: No other differences or changes observed in any rooms.\r\n\r\n## Session Conclusion\r\nExploratory session complete.

Observations\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Game Launch & Intro\r\n- Launching the game loads directly into gameplay.\r\n- A voice-over explanation plays immediately, giving narrative context about investigating planets and receiving a monetary bonus.\r\n- The intro does not provide information about the player’s character beyond the brief job explanation.\r\n\r\n### 1.2 Lobby Room Interactions\r\n- A shiny suit with a green rectangular outline appears interactable.\r\n- Interacting with the suit using **E** causes it to visually disappear.\r\n- No controls or onboarding tutorial is presented; movement and interaction controls must be inferred (**WASD + E**).\r\n- A persistent large pixel square follows behind the player at all times (visual). This appears every time the game launches. *(img. 1)*\r\n\r\n### 1.3 Navigation & Movement\r\n- Movement uses WASD + mouse by default.\r\n- Interaction works with **E** or left mouse click.\r\n- No UI hints appear to confirm these controls.\r\n\r\n### 1.4 Ladder Transition\r\n- Approaching the ladder and interacting with it transitions the player to the next stage/level.\r\n- No UI prompt or explanation appears before transition.\r\n\r\n### 1.5 Ship Control Panel\r\n- The ship panel contains a red **power** button that activates the system when pressed using **E** or left mouse click.\r\n- Interacting with the left screen places the player in a “screen view” showing numbers (0, 7).\r\n- There is no prompt explaining how to exit panel view; right mouse button appears to exit by player assumption.\r\n- A newer build now provides guidance from the central panel when selecting planets, which did not exist in the previous version.\r\n\r\n### 1.6 Progression Behavior\r\n- Based on prior testing, it was possible to “complete” the game by only performing the safety check examination without exploring any planets.\r\n- Retested in this build — behavior still appears possible. *(vid. 1)*  \r\n  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vtmNLVe67LOq0v0-142fxx48PJtHJ_Qp/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n### 1.7 Door Behavior\r\n- The main door opens and closes consistently using the interact button.\r\n- Other doors (not the main one) open with interaction but do not close again using the same button. *(vid. 2)*  \r\n  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W05bO1I0GGi3Eb2saU_hbyo7nCrH095E/view?usp=sharing\r\n- Standing between a door and its interact button allows the player to close the door through their body, visually clipping through the door interior.\r\n- Camera view temporarily shows inside of the door mesh. *(vid. 3)*  \r\n  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XKtmRtExZXW_vMa4hA_KwqeUzpZKm4sT/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n### 1.8 UI/Audio Issues\r\n- **UI saving issue:** settings appear persistent even when not saved, but are only applied when pressing **Save**. *(vid. 4)*  \r\n  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WjrKSpgpAGPcR2NIJPylC04tFn2y2gWM/view?usp=sharing\r\n- **Audio sliders do not fully mute** the game: some sound effects still play even if all audio options are disabled. *(vid. 5)*  \r\n  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ajuC_n1aeuuG2bHZx6YmA6sPsEByptMY/view?usp=sharing\r\n- **Language translation** is incorrect, inconsistent, or non-functional. *(img. 2, img. 3)*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Inferences\r\n- The game likely intends to show a main menu before gameplay (standard FPS/horror convention).\r\n- Interactable objects should visually disappear only if picked up intentionally — suit behavior may be correct but needs confirmation.\r\n- The pixel square behind the player is likely a rendering/visual bug rather than a game mechanic.\r\n- Control prompts are probably intended but not implemented yet.\r\n- Ladder transition appears intended but should ideally give feedback or confirmation before loading the next area.\r\n- Only the main door is fully implemented; secondary doors likely missing closing logic or animation state management.\r\n- Player should not clip through doors — collision should push the player aside.\r\n- Audio sliders should mute all sounds, including interactions.\r\n- Language setting should apply to UI text consistently.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Questions\r\n1. Is the game meant to bypass the main menu entirely, or is this a missing screen?\r\n2. Should the player receive onboarding prompts for controls (WASD, E, mouse)?\r\n3. Is the pixel square behind the player intended as an in-game effect or a rendering issue?\r\n4. Should interaction prompts (e.g., “Press E”) appear on interactable objects?\r\n5. Are players intended to exit panel screens with Right Mouse Button, or should a prompt appear?\r\n6. Is the ability to complete the game without visiting any planets intended or a progression oversight?\r\n7. Should all doors be able to open **and** close, or only the main door?\r\n8. Is door clipping intended, or should the player be pushed aside when a door closes?\r\n9. Should audio sliders fully mute all sounds, including panel and interaction effects?\r\n10. Is language selection intended to function in this build?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Raw Defect Notes\r\n- Pixel square artifact following the player every session.\r\n- Missing control prompts (new-player usability issue).\r\n- Secondary doors cannot be closed after opening.\r\n- Player can clip through door when standing between button + door.\r\n- Audio still plays even when all audio sliders are off.\r\n- UI settings appear persistent even when not saved.\r\n- Language selection not functioning.\r\n- Ability to complete game without performing planet exploration (possible progression bug).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Session Summary\r\nToday’s exploratory session focused on re-testing the introduction, the lobby, door behaviors, and the ship control panel. Several repeated behavior patterns were observed, particularly around UI settings, audio settings, and door interactions. New UI behavior was identified in the planet selection system. Multiple areas require clarification from the developer to properly document intended behavior and derive test conditions.","src/content/exploratory/EXP-GENE-001.md","10dd19c23cfc87c5",{"html":365,"metadata":366},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Area Under Test:\u003C/strong> Game introduction, lobby room, ship control area, UI/system interactions\u003Cbr>\n\u003Cstrong>Session Length:\u003C/strong> 30–45 minutes\u003Cbr>\n\u003Cstrong>PC System Model:\u003C/strong> ROG Strix G513RW_G513RW\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"1-observations\">1.

Region Transition & Entry\r\n- After completing Region 1 exploration, entered cryochamber for hibernation.\r\n- Upon awakening, confirmed transition to **Region 2**.\r\n\r\n### 2. Hallway Lighting Behavior\r\n- Walked into the hallway.\r\n- Observed light flickering event when walking near the intersection of the hallway.\r\n\r\n### 3. Room Status Check\r\n- Inspected hallway rooms.\r\n- Findings: No visible differences observed in the rooms.\r\n\r\n### 4. Camera Interface & Secret Discovery\r\n- Checked camera in the cockpit.\r\n- Display showed: **0/1** overlay in top right corner (1 scannable object, 0 scanned).\r\n- Located a small white object in the camera view.\r\n- Held [E] to interact with the object.\r\n- System message: **\"You discovered a secret\"**\r\n- Note: The counter remained at **0/1** after this discovery.\r\n\r\n### 5. Secret File Analysis - LAD.r\r\n- Checked **Filesystem** terminal.\r\n- New file discovered: **LAD.r** (from scanning the secret).\r\n- Running LAD.r displayed a **raspberry stamp** image.\r\n- Interface included a **[x]** close button.\r\n- Clicking [x] closed the window and returned to the filesystem.\r\n\r\n### 6. Planet Discovery - Ladagocia\r\n- Returned to camera view (counter still at 0/1).\r\n- Located planet **Ladagocia**.\r\n- Scanned the planet.\r\n- Counter updated to **1/1**, indicating all main items in the region were scanned.\r\n\r\n### 7. Ladagociass.access Minigame\r\n- New file added to Filesystem: **Ladagociass.access**.\r\n- Running the file initiated the circular timing minigame (identical to Region 1 / Cerebellum.kp4).\r\n- Successfully completed the minigame.\r\n\r\n### 8. Report Generation System\r\n- Upon minigame completion, new file generated: **Report 02.kp4**.\r\n- Running the file initiated:\r\n  1. Video playback\r\n  2. Interactive report interface\r\n- Clicking buttons added words to the report.\r\n- Completed the report.\r\n\r\n### 9. Map Update & Mission Progression\r\n- Upon completing the report, camera view moved to map display.\r\n- Map indicator **[2]** changed to **checked** status.\r\n- Focus returned to camera, hovering over **Mesodion**.\r\n\r\n### 10. Course Setting\r\n- Interacted with **Mesodion** using [E].\r\n- Prompt displayed: **\"[X] SET COURSE [C]\"**\r\n- Pressed [C].\r\n- System response: **\"Expected duration: 14 weeks\"**\r\n- All screens faded to black.\r\n\r\n### 11. Door Interaction Inconsistency\r\n- On the return to the hallway, tested door interactions.\r\n- Observation: Side doors in the hallway can be opened by clicking [LMB] on the **door mesh** itself, rather than just the button.\r\n- This differs from the main door behavior (requires button interaction).\r\n\r\n### 12. Electrical Room Lighting Defect\r\n- Entered the electrical room.\r\n- Walked to the far-most right corner.\r\n- Observation: The light around the camera is **culled** (disappears) when standing in this specific corner.\r\n\r\n## Session Conclusion\r\nExploratory session complete for Region 2. Documented new environmental events (hallway flickering), discovered a secret item (\"LAD.r\"), and successfully scanned the region's planet (Ladagocia). Verified the recurrence of the timing minigame and report generation systems. Noted inconsistencies in door interactions and a lighting culling defect in the electrical room. Progression to the next stage confirmed with a 14-week transit time.","src/content/exploratory/EXP-2-001.md","1eaaef842e32d247",{"html":429,"metadata":430},"\u003Ch2 id=\"session-overview\">Session Overview\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Build/Platform: 20951743\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Area Under Test: Ship region 2 (hallway lighting, secret discovery, planet scanning, Ladagocia discovery, course setting)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"observations--findings\">Observations &#x26; Findings\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-region-transition--entry\">1.

Minigame Completion Error (NullReferenceException)\r\n- **Issue**: After completing each timing minigame, a `NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object` appears on screen.\r\n- **Frequency**: Occurs consistently after every minigame, across multiple planets.\r\n- **Impact**: The exception appears briefly and does not crash the game but is clearly not intended game behavior.\r\n\r\n### 2. Region 3 / Stage 3 – Camera System Workflow\r\n- **Context**: Upon arriving to Region 3, a new mission step appears involving malfunctioning cameras that must be repaired before progression.\r\n- **Issue**: The player receives no indication that the cameras are broken until checking the report terminal located at the main control panel.\r\n- **Bypass**: Camera repair can begin immediately, even before:\r\n    - Watching the main panel report video\r\n    - Reading any official instruction\r\n- **Result**: This allows the player to repair the cameras out of sequence in the gameplay flow.\r\n\r\n### 3. Camera Repair System Behavior\r\n- **Interaction**: Repairing a camera triggers a short animation/interaction that appears functional.\r\n- **Progression**: After all cameras are repaired, the story/mission progression continues normally.\r\n- **Defect**: There is no lock or gating mechanism preventing early repair.\r\n- **Video**: [Camera Repair Behavior](https://drive.google.com/file/d/193QFJAhrAhIsLXh7pJjb7ved8jcG3q_h/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### 4. File System Behavior on Arrival to Region 3\r\n- **Observation**: When reaching Region 3, the system automatically wipes old planet archives/reports from the file UI.\r\n- **Scope**: This includes previously completed planet data (e.g., Planet 1, Planet 2).\r\n- **Impact**: Removal of old archives does not break progression and may actually reduce the chance of the earlier bug where the game allowed repeated cryo cycles without visiting planets.\r\n- **Uncertainty**: It is unclear whether data wiping is intended behavior or temporary placeholder logic.\r\n- **Video**: [File System Behavior](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sJ37-iH6PxGiU7c_vmXDMO9XGMCtefL8/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### 5. End-Game Portal Error After Scanning All Available Planets\r\n- **Context**: After finishing all planets and completing the final cryo/minigame sequence, the game attempts to automatically transition the player to the next destination.\r\n- **Issue**: Since no additional planets exist in the build, the automatic travel logic triggers an error instead of handling the “no more destinations” case.\r\n- **Console Output**: `NullReferenceException: “Object reference not set to an instance of an object” “No destination region for portal target”`\r\n- **Behavior**: The error appears immediately when the game tries to perform the usual “auto-set course” step, causing a soft-break in progression. The game remains playable but does not advance to any next stage.\r\n\r\n## Inferences\r\n\r\n### 1. Minigame Error\r\n- `NullReferenceException` suggests a missing or improperly referenced script variable that fires when the minigame exits.\r\n- The error likely affects UI cleanup or player state transition.\r\n\r\n### 2. Region 3 Camera System\r\n- The intended gameplay structure seems to involve:\r\n    1. Arriving to the planet\r\n    2. Receiving a diagnostic report\r\n    3. Being told the cameras are malfunctioning\r\n    4. Repairing them\r\n- Since players can repair before receiving instructions, the mission sequence logic appears incomplete or insufficiently gated.\r\n\r\n### 3. Archive Wiping\r\n- The game might be trying to:\r\n    - Prevent player confusion\r\n    - Keep only current-planet data\r\n    - Fix sequencing issues from previous builds\r\n- Or, it may be an unintended side effect of new data-handling logic.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n1. Should camera repair be locked until the player first views the diagnostic video?\r\n2. Is the file system supposed to delete previous planet reports?\r\n3. Should players always retain historical planet reports for lore or reference?\r\n4. Should an end-sequence or message occur instead of a `NullReferenceException` when content is exhausted?\r\n\r\n## Raw Defect Notes\r\n- `NullReferenceException` appears after each minigame completion.\r\n- Camera repair can be done before watching the Region 3 diagnostic report.\r\n- End-of-content travel attempt results in `NullReferenceException` (“No destination region for portal target”).\r\n\r\n## Session Summary\r\nToday’s session focused on mission flow, the new camera repair objective, and the behavior of the file/archive system after progressing to a later stage. A recurring `NullReferenceException` was observed during minigame completion, indicating an ongoing script reference issue. The camera repair task is currently not gated behind mission instructions, allowing players to bypass narrative flow and perform tasks ahead of sequence. Finally, old planet archives are wiped automatically upon arrival to Region 3, which may be intentional or placeholder logic. An additional exception was observed when the game attempted to automatically transition to a non-existent next planet, suggesting incomplete end-of-content handling in the travel system. Further clarification is required to establish expected behavior before deriving formal test conditions.","src/content/exploratory/EXP-3-001.md","37a2704eccb2ba12",{"html":486,"metadata":487},"\u003Ch2 id=\"session-overview\">Session Overview\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Date\u003C/strong>: DEC/05/2025\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Build\u003C/strong>: Steam Client Build (Dec 05)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Area Under Test\u003C/strong>: Region 3 progression, minigame exit logic, camera repair\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Session Length\u003C/strong>: 30–45 minutes\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>PC System Model\u003C/strong>: ROG Strix G513RW_G513RW\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"observations--findings\">Observations &#x26; Findings\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-minigame-completion-error-nullreferenceexception\">1.

Neuros Terminal Activation\r\n- **Context**: Located on the left of the cabin after entering region 0b.\r\n- **Interaction**: Interacting with screen using [LMB] or [E] opens the Neuros terminal.\r\n- **Visuals**: Displays \"Neuros\" in red text with a \"301E\" subtext in white. A crudely drawn star spins every second or so above it.\r\n- **CLI Access**: Clicking [LMB] again opens the command line interface, printing \"NEUROS ONLINE\" in green text.\r\n\r\n### 2. CLI Functionality\r\n- **Prompt**: There is no visible prompt cursor initially.\r\n- **Help Command**: Typing \"help\" prints a list of available topics:\r\n    - Galactic Fruit\r\n    - Fabrica\r\n    - Ladagocia\r\n    - Mesodion\r\n- **Exit**: Clicking [RMB] exits the Neuros terminal.\r\n\r\n### 3. Lore Entries & Content\r\n- **Galactic Fruit**: Prints text details about the Intergalactic Corporation, their monopoly, and wealth compared to the Fabrican Royal Family.\r\n- **Fabrica**: Prints text identifying it as the homeworld of the Fabricans and a trade hub.\r\n- **Ladagocia**: Prints text describing a lush forest planet where Fabricans found \"Pimta\" fruit.\r\n\r\n### 4. Typo in Ladagocia Entry\r\n- **Issue**: The text for Ladagocia contains a grammatical error.\r\n- **Text**: \"Their they found a fruit the locals called Pimta.\"\r\n- **Correction**: Should be \"There they found...\"\r\n- **Action**: Defect ticket to be created.\r\n\r\n## Inferences\r\n\r\n### 1. Lore Distribution\r\n- The Neuros terminal appears to be a primary mechanism for world-building and distributing background lore to the player.\r\n\r\n### 2. Mesodion Command\r\n- Although \"Mesodion\" is listed in the help response, it was not explicitly tested in this session (or the output wasn't recorded), implying it likely follows the same pattern as the other lore entries.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n1. Are the commands case-sensitive?\r\n2. Does the \"Mesodion\" command function similarly to the others?\r\n3. Are there hidden commands not listed in \"help\"?\r\n\r\n## Raw Defect Notes\r\n- Typo in `Ladagocia` lore text: \"Their they found\" should be \"There they found\".\r\n\r\n## Session Summary\r\nExplored the Neuros terminal mechanics and content. Verified activation via [LMB]/[E] and CLI access. Documented the `help` command outputs and the specific lore text provided for Galactic Fruit, Fabrica, and Ladagocia. Identified a spelling/grammar error in the Ladagocia entry (\"Their\" instead of \"There\"). Confirmed [RMB] functionality to exit the terminal.","src/content/exploratory/EXP-Neuros-001.md","c84b839144462334",{"html":545,"metadata":546},"\u003Ch2 id=\"session-overview\">Session Overview\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Date\u003C/strong>: DEC/07/2025\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Build\u003C/strong>: 3049470\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Area Under Test\u003C/strong>: Neuros\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Session Length\u003C/strong>: 30–45 minutes\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"observations--findings\">Observations &#x26; Findings\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-neuros-terminal-activation\">1.
