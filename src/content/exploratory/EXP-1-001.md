## Session Overview
- Build/Platform: 20951743
- Area Under Test: Ship region 1 (hallway lighting, SAFETY.a training, planet scanning, Cerebellum discovery, course setting)

## Observations & Findings

### 1. Region Transition & Entry
- After completing 0b region exploration, entered cryochamber for hibernation.
- Upon awakening, developer tools confirmed transition to **Region 1**.

### 2. Hallway Lighting Sequence
- Opened door to hallway.
- Lighting behavior observed:
  - Lights began activating from opposite side of hallway
  - Lights turned on incrementally, creating visual sequence
  - Different from previous regions' instant lighting

### 3. Room Status Check
- Walked through hallway to inspect all rooms.
- Findings: No differences observed from 0b region rooms.
- Proceeded directly to cockpit.

### 4. New Filesystem Content & Camera Interface
- Inspected **Filesystem** terminal.
- New file discovered: **SAFETY.a**
- Camera system changes:
  - Display showed: **0/1** overlay in top right corner
  - Interpreted as: 1 scannable object available, 0 scanned

### 5. Initial Planet Discovery - Ladagocia
- Located planet **Ladagocia** in camera view.
- Attempted interaction using [E] and [LMB].
- System response: **"REPORT ON PLANET BEFORE CONTINUING"**
- Interaction blocked until prerequisite completed.

### 6. SAFETY.a Training Video
- Returned to **Filesystem** terminal to investigate SAFETY.a file.
- Running SAFETY.a initiated video playback.
- Video content: Safety briefing about power restoration procedures.
- Key information: "If power goes out, restore it in the electrical room."

### 7. Camera Re-check & Second Planet Discovery
- Re-interacted with camera after viewing SAFETY.a.
- **Ladagocia** still displayed same message: "REPORT ON PLANET BEFORE CONTINUING"
- Continued searching camera view for other planets.
- Located different planet with new interaction prompt: **[SCAN: E]**

### 8. Planet Scanning Mechanic - Cerebellum
- Tested scanning mechanic on newly discovered planet.
- Scan controls:
  - Hold [E] to initiate and maintain scan animation
  - Releasing [E] stops animation
  - Must hold [E] for full animation duration to complete scan
- Upon successful scan completion:
  - System message: **Planet discovered: 'Cerebellum'**
  - New file automatically added to Filesystem: **Cerebellum.kp4**

### 9. Cerebellum.kp4 Minigame
- Ran **Cerebellum.kp4** from Filesystem terminal.
- Minigame initiated with timing challenge:
  - Slider moves around circular track
  - Small red sections mark target zones
  - Player must click [LMB] when slider reaches red sections
  - Timing-based success condition

### 10. Report Generation System
- Upon minigame completion, new file generated: **report.kp4**
- Running report.kp4 initiated two-part sequence:
  1. Video playback
  2. Interactive **Cerebellum Report** interface opened
- Report interface mechanics:
  - Multiple button options displayed
  - Clicking button adds corresponding word(s) to report
  - Example: Clicking 'aaa' added three words: "Detemeter > GFHQ"
  - Progressive report building through button selections

### 11. Map Update & Mission Progression
- Upon completing **Cerebellum** report:
  - Camera view automatically moved to map display
  - Map indicator **[1]** changed to **checkmark** symbol (✓)
  - Focus automatically returned to camera
  - Camera immediately centered on **Ladagocia** planet

### 12. Course Setting - Ladagocia
- Interacted with **Ladagocia** again after report completion.
- Previous blocking message replaced with new prompt: **"[X] SET COURSE [C]"**
- Tested controls:
  - Clicking [X] closes the prompt (cancel action)
  - Re-interacted with planet using [E]
  - Pressed [C] but nothing happened
    - This is a defect, will make a ticket.
  - Tried Pressed [LMB] to confirm course setting
- System response:
  - Display showed: **"Expected duration: 17 weeks"**
  - All screens faded to black
  - Ship entered transit state

### 13. Return to Hibernation
- Navigated back through hallway to hibernation room.
- Room inspection results: No changes detected in any hallway rooms.
- Proceeded to hibernation room.
- Interacted with **Cryochamber** to initiate hibernation.

### 14. Region Transition to Region 2
- After hibernation sequence ("..."), awakened in new region.
- Developer tools confirmed transition to **Region 2**.
- This marks conclusion of Region 1 exploration.

## Session Conclusion
Exploratory session complete. Successfully explored Region 1 and discovered new gameplay systems including hallway lighting sequences, planet scanning mechanics, and report generation. Completed SAFETY.a training video, discovered and scanned Cerebellum planet, successfully completed timing-based minigame, and generated planet report. Map progression system confirmed working (checkpoint [1] marked complete). Successfully set course to Ladagocia with 17-week transit time and transitioned to Region 2 via hibernation. All core Region 1 mechanics functioning as expected.
