## Session Overview
- Build/Platform: 20951743
- Area Under Test: Ship 0b region (Neuros terminal, evaluation.kp4 minigame, paper placement)

## Observations & Findings

### 1. Entry into 0b Region
- Upon entering the 0b region, navigated to the cockpit.
- Region transition occurred after hibernation sequence from intro area.

### 2. Neuros Terminal Discovery
- **Neuros** terminal discovered on the left side of the cockpit.
- Terminal features:
  - New terminal type not present in previous region
  - Interactable using [E] or [LMB]

### 3. Neuros CLI Interface
- Clicking on **Neuros** terminal opens CLI (Command Line Interface) tool.
- System immediately prints: "NEUROS ONLINE"
- Input behavior:
  - All typed letters are automatically converted to uppercase
  - Command-based interaction system

### 4. HELP Command & Database Entries
- Typing 'HELP' command displays list of available entries:
  - **Galactic Fruit**
  - **Fabrica**
  - **Ladagocia** 
  - **Mesdoion**
- Typing any of these terms displays description of the corresponding planet or object.
- Exit mechanism: Clicking [RMB] closes the Neuros terminal.

### 5. Paper Placement Issue
- Paper that was previously mounted on wall is now on the floor.
- Interaction behavior:
  - Clicking on paper repositions it back to original wall location
  - **Defect Identified:** Paper placement obscures the Neuros terminal
    - Expected: Paper should not block interactive terminals
    - Actual: Paper covers Neuros terminal when placed, preventing interaction

### 6. Filesystem Terminal Check
- Navigated to cockpit and interacted with **Filesystem** terminal.
- Power status confirmed: **Power: 5** (unchanged from previous region)
- New file discovered in 'Temp' directory: **Evaluation.kp4**

### 7. Evaluation.kp4 Minigame
- Running Evaluation.kp4 file initiates minigame sequence.
- Minigame instructions: "Click 'the button' when a red face appears"
- Sequence observed:
  - Green face displayed first
  - Screen goes black
  - Red face appears
- Pressed [E] (intuited as correct button) when red face appeared.
- Result: Successful completion of minigame.

### 8. Camera & Scanning Attempt
- Interacted with camera system.
- Display showed: **0/0** in top right corner.
- Attempted to scan for planets or objects.
- Result: No scannable objects detected in 0b region.

### 9. Return to Hibernation
- Turned around and navigated back to hibernation room for cryosleep.
- Conducted thorough check of all rooms along the route.
- Findings: No other differences or changes observed in any rooms.

## Session Conclusion
Exploratory session complete. Successfully explored 0b region and discovered new Neuros terminal system with database entries for four planetary bodies. Identified defect with paper placement blocking terminal interaction. Completed Evaluation.kp4 minigame successfully. No scannable objects found in camera system. All other ship areas remained unchanged from previous region.
