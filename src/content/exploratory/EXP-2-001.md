## Session Overview
- Build/Platform: 20951743
- Area Under Test: Ship region 2 (hallway lighting, secret discovery, planet scanning, Ladagocia discovery, course setting)

## Observations & Findings

### 1. Region Transition & Entry
- After completing Region 1 exploration, entered cryochamber for hibernation.
- Upon awakening, confirmed transition to **Region 2**.

### 2. Hallway Lighting Behavior
- Walked into the hallway.
- Observed light flickering event when walking near the intersection of the hallway.

### 3. Room Status Check
- Inspected hallway rooms.
- Findings: No visible differences observed in the rooms.

### 4. Camera Interface & Secret Discovery
- Checked camera in the cockpit.
- Display showed: **0/1** overlay in top right corner (1 scannable object, 0 scanned).
- Located a small white object in the camera view.
- Held [E] to interact with the object.
- System message: **"You discovered a secret"**
- Note: The counter remained at **0/1** after this discovery.

### 5. Secret File Analysis - LAD.r
- Checked **Filesystem** terminal.
- New file discovered: **LAD.r** (from scanning the secret).
- Running LAD.r displayed a **raspberry stamp** image.
- Interface included a **[x]** close button.
- Clicking [x] closed the window and returned to the filesystem.

### 6. Planet Discovery - Ladagocia
- Returned to camera view (counter still at 0/1).
- Located planet **Ladagocia**.
- Scanned the planet.
- Counter updated to **1/1**, indicating all main items in the region were scanned.

### 7. Ladagociass.access Minigame
- New file added to Filesystem: **Ladagociass.access**.
- Running the file initiated the circular timing minigame (identical to Region 1 / Cerebellum.kp4).
- Successfully completed the minigame.

### 8. Report Generation System
- Upon minigame completion, new file generated: **Report 02.kp4**.
- Running the file initiated:
  1. Video playback
  2. Interactive report interface
- Clicking buttons added words to the report.
- Completed the report.

### 9. Map Update & Mission Progression
- Upon completing the report, camera view moved to map display.
- Map indicator **[2]** changed to **checked** status.
- Focus returned to camera, hovering over **Mesodion**.

### 10. Course Setting
- Interacted with **Mesodion** using [E].
- Prompt displayed: **"[X] SET COURSE [C]"**
- Pressed [C].
- System response: **"Expected duration: 14 weeks"**
- All screens faded to black.

### 11. Door Interaction Inconsistency
- On the return to the hallway, tested door interactions.
- Observation: Side doors in the hallway can be opened by clicking [LMB] on the **door mesh** itself, rather than just the button.
- This differs from the main door behavior (requires button interaction).

### 12. Electrical Room Lighting Defect
- Entered the electrical room.
- Walked to the far-most right corner.
- Observation: The light around the camera is **culled** (disappears) when standing in this specific corner.

## Session Conclusion
Exploratory session complete for Region 2. Documented new environmental events (hallway flickering), discovered a secret item ("LAD.r"), and successfully scanned the region's planet (Ladagocia). Verified the recurrence of the timing minigame and report generation systems. Noted inconsistencies in door interactions and a lighting culling defect in the electrical room. Progression to the next stage confirmed with a 14-week transit time.
